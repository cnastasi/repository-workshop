### Repository Workshop

That project contains the php files needed for a workshop of mine. 

It follow a path from a pseudo-legacy code to a well designed code.

The goal of the workshop is to explain how following a SOLID approach 
brings to more testable code and also, how the Repository pattern can 
 improve the speed of automatic tests (unfortunately the example is too
 small to be a significative)
 
The workshop begin from step0 tag and its almost full covered by tests. 

Every steps brings code refactorization and improvement in design.
 
In the workshop I'll explain the meaning of the every step.
